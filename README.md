# raze
Rust API bindings for the BackBlaze B2 API.
Provides raw API calls or an easy-to-use struct via the engine module.

The calls are documented and should be pretty obvious if you've read the [official docs][1]

There is an example project using this library to make a simple CLI backup tool: [raze-cli][2]

This library is a proof of concept to show simple API calls. Refer to https://crates.io/crates/backblaze-b2 for a complete implementation.
